# OANDA-bot
Hey guys this is the readme for our ongoing project :-) 

It is based on - 

https://github.com/quantroom-pro/pyrenko and it is recommended to read -

https://towardsdatascience.com/renko-brick-size-optimization-34d64400f60e for a good understanding. 

As you can see I have added on how to use it with historical data from OANDA and a demo account key. Right now the prices from the Live Stream are being downloaded, but they don´t form the Renko Chart or Pattern like they should and plot a graphic. The optimal brick size is choosen from the previous optimization. 

Hope you enjoy!
Any hints on how to improve the code are welcome!
