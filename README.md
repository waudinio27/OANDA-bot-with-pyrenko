# OANDA-bot-Ashish-Mark-Matthias

Hey guys this is the readme for our ongoing project :-) 

It is based on - 

https://github.com/quantroom-pro/pyrenko and it is recommended to read -

https://towardsdatascience.com/renko-brick-size-optimization-34d64400f60e for a good understanding. 

As you can see I have added on how to use it with historical data from OANDA and a demo account key. We will have to work out the Real Time connection for Live Trading and also some proper risk management. 

Hope you enjoy!
