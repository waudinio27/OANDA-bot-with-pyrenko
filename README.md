# OANDA-bot
Hey guys this is the readme for an ongoing project :-) 

It is based on brilliant work of Sergey Malchevskiy - 

https://github.com/quantroom-pro/pyrenko and it is recommended to read -

https://towardsdatascience.com/renko-brick-size-optimization-34d64400f60e for a good understanding. 

As you can see I have added on how to use it with historical data from OANDA and a demo account key. Right now the prices from the Live Stream are being downloaded, but they donÂ´t form the Renko Chart or Pattern like they should and plot a graphic. The values from the stream should get added to a second pandas dataframe but right now it is only showing NAN values. The optimal brick size is choosen from the previous optimization. 

Hope you enjoy!
Any hints on how to improve the code are welcome!
